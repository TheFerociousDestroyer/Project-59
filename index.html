        My Favourite Character Jotaro Kujo is from an anime called Jojo's Bizzare Adventure the anime has 6 seasons the character I most liked is in season 3 and 4, and that character is none other than jotaro kujo but the most important part is why do I like this character. The reason I like this character is because he is cool and a good person, he and his grandfather with his friends with amazing power go on a journey to kill a mighty threat named Dio Brando! who wants to control the world after defeating him Jotaro Kujo's stand evolved to Star Platinum The World! And he swear to protect the world and his daughter Jolyne Cujoh.
        The Power He Had Was Called A Stand, A stand is a Manifestion of the fighting spirit of someone. The Stand's Name Of Jotaro Kujo is Star Platinum!
